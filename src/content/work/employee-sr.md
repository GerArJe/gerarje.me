## Resume

The objective of this project was to develop a prototype mobile application that uses Machine Learning to generate employee recommendations for companies in the footwear sector.

The application has two user profiles: company and employee. Both profiles interact to complete the full interaction. Companies that are looking for new employees, and the employees that are looking to be hired.
